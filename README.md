#Abbrase POS (Parts of Speech)#

Abbrase is an abbreviated passphrase generator. An abbrase is one of the passwords it produces. It generates a password and a phrase like "phyeigdolrejutt" and "physical eight dollars rejected utterly".

Try the [web version](http://bcaller.github.io/abbrase).

Creating secure passwords is easy. Remembering them is hard. [Pwgen](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pwgen/) makes them memorable though prounouncability. XKCD [suggests](http://xkcd.com/936/) using a series of random common words, but memorizing series of unrelated words can be difficult, and typing long phrases can be tedious.

Abbrase POS uses parts of speech to make phrases of the form ADJECTIVES*-NOUN-VERB-ADJECTIVES*-NOUN, and abbreviating each word to the first few letters. This strikes a balance between excessive password length and excessive mnemonic length. Passwords generated by Abbrase are as secure as a number with the same length. "122079103" and "toldulbal" (tolerably dull ball) are equally hard to attack.

See [the original by rmmh](http://rmmh.github.io/abbrase) for a more sophisticated version using bigrams and Markov chains. I, however, prefer the results from this version. A combination of the two approaches may be even better, although n-gram data includes articles and prepositions (a, the, for, ofâ€¦) which I ignore.

The wordlist was generated with data from Google NGrams [dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html), used under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). However, it needed slight modification as there are some words which have the wrong parts of speech tagged or are OCR mistakes. A better solution to my modifications is possible soon.

##Theory##

Language is the most information-dense thing people memorize. Brains don't operate on bits.

Pi recitation record-holders don't have thousands of digits in their minds. They map clusters of digits to far more mentally palatable words, memorizing a long story instead of a sequence of digits.

Memorizing a grammatically-sensible sentence fragment is easier than a sequence of randomly chosen words.

Picking a favorite phrase from the ones generated by Abbrase could make them very slightly easier to attack. A sophisticated attacker could check passwords that are likely to be picked before others. If the attacker can perfectly model which passwords you would prefer, this reduces the security of your password in a proportioanl amount to the number of passwords you selected it from -- if you picked from 32 passwords generated by abbrase, it makes your password 32x easier to attack (5 bits of security lost).

##Building##

    git clone https://github.com/bcaller/abbrase.git
    cd abbrase
    make
    ./abbrase
    
If you want to make your own prefix list of 1024 3-letter prefixes (as I have):

* Put comma separated prefixes.txt in ./data
* Download all http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/googlebooks-eng-all-1gram-20120701-[a-z].gz for [a-z] with prefixes to ./data/[a-z].gz
* Run py unigrams.py to make unigrams.json

unigrams.json is a dictionary of "prefix" : Array(Array(adjective suffixes), Array(noun suffixes), Array(verb suffixes)) and can be modified if you want

##Getting phrases##
abbrase.py
or
	from abbrase import abbrase
	abbrase(num=7)


##FAQ##

*Q:* Isn't using a phrase more secure than abbreviating it?

*A:* Not at all for phrases Abbrase generates. Displayed phrases are generated deterministically from the password, so they have no added security. Otherwise yes, 4 words have more security than 4 abbreviated words, but they're less convenient to type, and the added characters aren't as valuable as the first few characters.
